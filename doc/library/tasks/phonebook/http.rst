=============================================
``http`` -- A Phonebook Web-Interface Backend
=============================================

.. automodule:: lib.tasks.phonebook.http

.. autoclass:: HttpBackend

.. We don't need to describe HttpBackend's attributes or methods, or the
   HttpLdapDataHint class, because they are exactly the same as is described in
   PhonebookBackend, and because nobody will interact with them directly
   anyways.
