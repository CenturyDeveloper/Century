What is Century?
----------------

Let's say you'd like to write a simple script to work with a certain page on the
University of Florida website. What may seem like a simple task could very well
prove quite complicated: you'll have to handle authentication, cookies,
redirects, and often times broken html. When it comes down to it, UF's webpages
don't play well with scripting.

Century handles automation of the UF site, and does it for you with an
extensible, documented API. Now you can write that app, without worrying about
where you're going to get the data from. Tasks that took a few thousand lines of
code now only take a couple hundred. We're here to make what should've been an
open system, open.

Please note that we are not affiliated with the University of Florida in any
way. This API is unofficial, and unsupported by UF. If you manage to get in
trouble while using it, it's your own fault.
